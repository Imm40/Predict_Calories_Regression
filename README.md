# Predicting Burned Calories on Workout
## Data Overview
Calories are a measure of energy. Since calories are, effectively, energy, any time energy is used or transformed in our body we consume calories. To examine, the most effective way to burn calories, we will see the most contributing factors. The information in this proposal for the database will discuss how the problem has developed (including seven specific problems), and present a possible solution.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of 9 features and 15,000 observations.

Below is a description of the features: 

| Feature name  | Description   | Data type |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| User_ID       | unique number | int           |
| Gender        | male or female | object       |
| Age           | person age    | int           |
| Height        | person height | float         |
| Weight        | person weight | float         |
| Duration      | time of exercise | float      |
| Heart_Rate    | Heart rate during exercise | float |
| Body_Temp     | Body temperature during exercise | float |
| Calories      | The number of calories burned | float |

## Questions
1. How can age affect performance time during a workout?

2. What are the factors that affect how high or low heart rate during a workout?

3. What is the rate of burning calories compared to the time of workout?

4. What is the difference between male and female in the duration of workout and burned calories?

5. What is the relationship between weight and burned calories?

6. What are the oldest ages that achieve high calorie burn?

7. What is the difference between male and female in height and weight?

## MVP goals
1. Find out what factors affect how high and low the heart is during exercise.

2. We want to get the difference between males and females in the duration of exercise and calories burned.

3. We get the calorie burn rate compared to your workout time.

4. We conclude the oldest ages that achieve high calorie burning.
